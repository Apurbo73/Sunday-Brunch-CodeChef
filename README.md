This code reads an integer t, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers a and b, then calculates the result of integer division a / b, storing it in c. The program then checks if c is greater than 20.

If c is greater than 20, it prints 20; otherwise, it prints the value of c. Essentially, this code caps the result of a / b at 20 and is useful in scenarios where a maximum limit is applied to a computed value, such as score normalization or capped pricing.


**Execution time** in coding refers to the amount of time a program takes to run from **start to finish**. It's usually measured in **seconds** or **milliseconds** and includes all the operations your code performs, like reading input, doing calculations, and printing output.

In competitive programming or coding contests, execution time is important because each problem has a **time limit** (like 1 second or 0.5 seconds). If your code takes **longer** than that, it gets a **Time Limit Exceeded (TLE)** error — meaning your solution may be correct, but it’s **too slow** to be accepted. So, writing efficient (fast) code is key to passing all test cases.
